Interrupt driven assembly code.  Button press turns on LED and Buzzer. Uses ATmega328P w/ Arduino.  

Below is the circuit you need to create for the Button.

* Note: For the Resistors in the above images, you just need a resistance value big enough to limit the current (so the sucker doesn't blow itself out) and a similar value for the Pull-Up Res.
